## About memory model

Due to the copyright issues of commercial PDK, the memory model generated by it cannot be made public. Therefore, the instantiation template is left in the mem_model folder. If you have the relevant memory model file, you can directly use them by replacing the module name.

The shapes of the memory model include:

1. 512x64
2. 1024x36
3. 4096x32
4. 8192x36

## How to use

Currently, the `artifacts` directory contains testdata.yml and program.hex files for 7 curves that have already been generated (BN254/462/638; BLS12-381/446/638; BLS24-509).
To use them, navigate to the `define` directory and run `paramgen.py`. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/finesse/define
python paramgen.py -i /path/to/finesse/artifacts/bls12_381_testdata.yml -x /path/to/finesse/artifacts/bls12_381_program.hex -o params.svh

```

Note: The `-i` input YAML file and the `-x` input HEX file must use absolute paths.

This will generate the corresponding macro definition file(params.svh), which can then be used normally with the related hardware RTL code.
